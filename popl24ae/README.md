# POPL24 Artifact Evaluation

We explain how to reproduce the evaluation results shown in Table 1 and 2 in the following paper:

Fuga Kawamata, Hiroshi Unno, Taro Sekiyama, and Tachio Terauchi. Answer Refinement Modification: Refinement Type System for Algebraic Effects and Handlers. POPL 2024.

## Installation from Source Code

* Install opam2 (see [the official webpage](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)).
* Install ocaml-5.3.0:
  ```bash
  opam switch create 5.3.0
  ```
* Install dune:
  ```bash
  opam install dune
  ```
* Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hiroshi-unno/coar.git -b POPL24AE
  ```
* Move to the directory:
  ```bash
  cd coar
  ```
* Install required packages:
  ```bash
  opam install . --deps-only
  ```
  (You may also need to install `libblas-dev`, `liblapack-dev`, `libmpfr-dev`, `libgmp-dev`, `libglpk-dev`, `libffi-dev`, and `pkg-config`)
* Build:
  ```bash
  dune build main.exe
  ```

Now you can run a sanity test by the following command:
```bash
./_build/default/main.exe -c ./config/solver/rcaml_pcsat_tb_ar.json -p ml ./benchmarks/OCaml/safety/simple/sum.ml
```
(or also you can build and run sequentially by the following command:)
```bash
dune exec main -- -c ./config/solver/rcaml_pcsat_tb_ar.json -p ml ./benchmarks/OCaml/safety/simple/sum.ml
```
If the installation has been done successfully, you will see the output similar to below:
```
unsat,0         @assert type_of(sum) <: ($x208:int) -> {$v212: int | $v212 >_#svar13 $x208} [#1] 
sat,9           @assert type_of(sum) <: ($x219:{$v224: int | $v224 >_#svar15 1}) -> {$v223: int | $v223 >_#svar18 $x219} [#2] 
sat,3           @assert type_of(sum) <: ($x230:int) -> {$v234: int | $v234 >=_#svar21 $x230} [#3]
```

## Run the Evaluation
```bash
cd popl24ae
./exp.sh
```

This will reproduce the results shown in Table 1 and 2 in the paper. It takes about 60 minutes to be completed.

* The results corresponding to the "Spacer" column in Table 1 will be output in `results_spacer.csv`.
* The results corresponding to the "PCSat" column in Table 1 will be output in `results_pcsat.csv`.
* The results corresponding to Table 2 will be output in `results_cps.csv`.

(At the same time, log messages will appear in the standard output.) In each CSV file, the first column contains the program file names, the second one contains the verification results, and the third one contains the evaluation time (in seconds).

For each line `results_spacer.csv` and `results_pcsat.csv`, if the result is "sat" or "unsat" and it matches the prefix of the file name ("`-SAT`" or "`-UNSAT`"), we put "Yes" in the "result correct?" column in Table 1, and "No" if it does not match. Also, the evaluation time is put in the "time" column in Table 1. If the result is "timeout", we put "timeout" in the "time" column in Table 1. If the result is "unknown", it indicates that some error occurs and we put "Abort" in the "result correct?" column in Table 1.

In `results_cps.csv`, we have three kinds of the suffix of the file names: `_DS`, `_CPS`, and `_CPS_opt`. They correspond to the column "DS", "CPS", and "CPS (optimized)" in Table 2 respectively. (e.g., the result of the file `choose-easy_CPS.ml` is written at the "`choose-easy`" row and the "CPS" column in Table 2.) For each result, if the result is "sat", we put "Yes" in the "verified?" column in Table 2, and "No" if "unsat". Also, the evaluation time is put in the "time" column in Table 2.

We provide a script to convert the CSV files into new CSV files
that have almost the same structure as the tables in the paper.
```bash
./convert.sh
```
This produces three CSV files: `table_spacer.csv`, `table_pcsat.csv`, and `table_cps.csv`.
The first two files correspond to Table 1 in the paper,
and the third one corresponds to Table 2 in the paper.

### Note
- Depending on machine performance, some results may differ from the ones in the paper since they require a lot of resources. For example, the evaluation of `amb-3-SAT.ml` in the "PCSat" configuration may time out, or the evaluation of `distribution-SAT.ml` in the "PCSat" configuration may be out of memory (which will show "abort" as the result).
- You can change some parameters by editing the variables declared at the beginning of the script `exp.sh`:
  - `timeout`: Time limit in seconds.
  - `para`: The number of parallel executions. You can disable parallelism by setting this variable to `1`.
  - `memlimit`: Memory limit in GB. By changing this variable, you can exclude benchmarks that require more than `memlimit` GB of memory. The amount of required memory for each benchmark is based on a measurement of memory usage  performed on our machine, which is listed in `memusage_spacer.csv`, `memusage_pcsat.csv`, and `memusage_cps.csv`.

## Additional Artifact Description
- The benchmark program files are located at `<porject root>/benchmarks/OCaml/popl24/arm/` (for Table 1) and `<porject root>/benchmarks/OCaml/popl24/cps/` (for Table 2).
- You can verify your program written in (subset of) OCaml (maybe with algebraic effects and handlers) by the following command (at the project root directory):
  ```bash
  ./_build/default/main.exe -c <config file> -p ml ./path/to/program.ml
  ```
  The `<config file>` can be either
  - `./config/solver/rcaml_pcsat_tb_ar.json`: which is used in the "PCSat" configuration in Table 1, or
  - `./config/solver/rcaml_wopp_spacer.json`: which is used in the "Spacer" configuration in Table 1 and Table 2.
