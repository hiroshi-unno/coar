(* Two nested handlers, and every operation that reaches a handler has a
   clause there: the inner one answers [Ask] with [false] and forwards [Bad]
   by an explicit clause; the outer one handles only [Bad], by discarding the
   continuation.  [Ask] never reaches the outer handler.  The inner body
   performs [Bad], the forwarded call is aborted by the outer clause, and the
   program returns (): [Bad] never reaches the top level, so sat.  A
   translation that requires the outer handler to have a clause for every
   operation of the inner handler's signature, [Ask] included, stops. *)
